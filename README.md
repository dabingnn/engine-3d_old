## Game Engine 3D

A simple 3d game engine

## Install

Clone the repo and run in the directory:

```bash
npm install
```

**NOTE**

If you're having trouble installing electron, try to use a Chinese mirror for it. To achieve this, just comment out electron field in dependencies section in package.json, then run:

```bash
npm install
```

After that, restore the electron field and run the command below:

```bash
cnpm install electron
```

## Development

To build the project, please run:

```bash
npm run build
```

If you change the code frequently, you can just start a dev process:

```bash
npm run dev
```

The process will watch your files, and build the project when they changes.
